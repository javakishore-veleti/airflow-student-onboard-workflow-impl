# Apache Airflow Student Onboard Workflow Implementation

## Introduction
This repository contains Apache Airflow Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) designed to automate the onboarding process for students enrolling in courses. The solution involves two primary DAGs: the **Main_DAG** and the **BP_DAG** (Business Process DAG), working in tandem to streamline student data processing and course enrollment.
